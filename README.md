# Real-Time Data Processing Pipeline Using Amazon Kinesis and Amazon Redshift

## Description
The idea is to build a real-time data pipeline that ingests data via Kinesis, processes it with Lambda, stores it in Redshift for analytical querying, and optionally uses Glue for data cataloging and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) transformations if needed.
